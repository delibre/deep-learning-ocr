# AO_Project

The topic of the project was to create a program that could read text from image, our own OCR.

A model which translates separate characters from image into symbols from ASCII table was written 
in Python. A part of a program which was detecting text on images and cutting it into seperate symbols was written in MATLAB.
To connect both parts of a program was used a server in Python which was taking requests from MATLAB client.
