# AO_Project

The topic of the project was to create a program that could read text from image, our own OCR.

A model which translates separate characters from image into symbols from ASCII table was trained using 
Python. A part of a program which detects text on images and cuts it into seperate symbols is written in MATLAB.
To connect both parts of a program a server in Python was used which was processing requests from MATLAB client.
